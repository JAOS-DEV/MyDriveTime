- Validation: Only valid 24-hour times (including 24:00) and numeric input are accepted, with instant error feedback.
- Multiple Rows: Add and clear multiple time ranges.
- Live Calculation: Elapsed time is calculated and displayed instantly for each row and as a total.
- Example Row & Labels: Clear example and column headers for user guidance.
- Auto-focus & Auto-add: Automatically moves to "To" input after 4 digits, and adds new row when completing last row.
- Delete Rows: Individual row deletion with "×" button (clears last row instead of deleting).
- Clear All Confirmation: Confirmation dialog before clearing all entries.
- Persistence: Automatic saving and loading of entries using AsyncStorage (data persists on app close/reopen).
